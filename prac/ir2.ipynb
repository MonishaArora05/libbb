    "Here's a step-by-step summary of what each part of the code is doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install pgmpy**: Installs the `pgmpy` library, which is used for probabilistic graphical models like Bayesian Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import Libraries**: Imports necessary libraries:\n",
    "   - `pandas` for data manipulation,\n",
    "   - `pgmpy` for Bayesian Network modeling and inference,\n",
    "   - `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder` for potential label encoding (though not used in the final code),\n",
    "   - `numpy` for numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load the Dataset**: Reads the `heart.csv` file into a DataFrame (`df`) and previews the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check for Missing Values**: Prints the number of missing values in each column to check data completeness before processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Discretize 'age' and 'chol' Columns**:\n",
    "   - Converts the continuous values in the `age` and `chol` columns into categorical bins (e.g., 'Young', 'Middle', 'Old' for age and 'Low', 'Normal', 'High' for cholesterol).\n",
    "   - This step helps convert continuous data into categories that are easier for Bayesian Networks to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Define Bayesian Network Structure**:\n",
    "   - Creates a Bayesian Network model with specified edges (connections).\n",
    "   - The structure specifies that `age`, `chol`, and `cp` influence `target`, and `target` influences `thalach`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Display Edges**: Prints out the edges of the Bayesian Network to confirm the model structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Train the Model (Fit)**:\n",
    "   - Trains the Bayesian Network on the dataset using the Maximum Likelihood Estimator, which estimates parameters of the network based on the data provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Set Up Inference (Variable Elimination)**:\n",
    "   - Initializes the Variable Elimination algorithm for inference on the trained model.\n",
    "   - This allows querying the model for probability distributions under given conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Query the Model**:\n",
    "    - Queries the model for the probability distribution of `target` given specific evidence:\n",
    "      - First query: `{'age': 'Old', 'chol': 'High'}`,\n",
    "      - Second query: `{'age': 'Middle', 'chol': 'Normal', 'cp': 2}`.\n",
    "    - Prints the results of these queries to see the predicted probabilities for `target` given each set of evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence builds and trains a Bayesian Network, prepares it for inference, and performs probability queries based on observed values."
